The services within our system architecture are modular and reusable components that manage specific functionalities. They are organized into three categories:

- **External Services**: Third-party platforms integrated for added functionalities.
- **External APIs**: APIs from other platforms that our system consumes.
- **App API & GRPC Services**: Custom-built APIs and services that power our app's core functionalities.
