The Electronic Complaint Management System (E-CMS) is designed to be a robust, scalable, and secure platform for handling customer complaints efficiently.

The architecture is optimized for performance and ensures that the system is not locked into any specific vendor.

This document outlines the system's design and architecture, divided into four main sections: Services, Processes, Application, and Infrastructure.
