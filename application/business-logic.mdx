In a system like E-CMS, where complaints undergo various stages of evaluation, routing, and resolution, the business logic serves as the backbone. This section outlines the intricacies of this vital component, focusing on how the application adheres to, and executes, various business rules and algorithms.

### Complaint Evaluation and Prioritization

Given the sensitivity and urgency often associated with public complaints, a robust evaluation and prioritization mechanism is in place. Using predefined criteria and complex algorithms, each incoming complaint is analyzed and classified based on its nature, impact, and urgency.

### Timeframe Logic

The application strictly adheres to the Citizen Charter's timeframe guidelines, notably the 3-7-20 day rule. We have embedded automated checks and alerts that inform both the user and the responsible departments about upcoming or missed deadlines, thus ensuring timely responses and actions.

### ARTABLE Algorithm

The term "ARTABLE" encapsulates a specific business rule that plays a pivotal role in complaint validation. Our application integrates this logic seamlessly to evaluate if a complaint fits within the Citizen Charter's parameters, automating what was once a manual, error-prone process.

### Role-based Access and Workflow

Access to various features and functionalities is role-based, allowing for a secure, organized, and effective workflow. This enables a hierarchical and departmental approach to complaint management.

### Integration Points

Our business logic is designed to work cohesively with external systems and services. It interfaces smoothly with the Gmail Add-Ons and various other APIs, ensuring seamless data flow and feature interoperability.

### Automations and Notifications

Automated routines and notifications are in place to streamline repetitive tasks and keep users informed. For example, upon successful complaint submission, an automated email acknowledgment is sent to the user.

By adhering to these business rules and algorithms, the application not only automates but also optimizes the entire complaint management process. The focus here is on accuracy, efficiency, and compliance, ensuring that the E-CMS is a reliable and robust platform for both users and administrators.
