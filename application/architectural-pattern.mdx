title: Architectural Pattern
---
For the E-CMS, our architecture is designed to balance simplicity with flexibility, combining a unified codebase with modular separation. This approach enables easier deployment, testing, and management while also allowing individual components to be developed, scaled, and maintained independently.

## Key Features of Our Architectural Choice

- Unified Codebase: All functionalities exist within a single codebase, which simplifies deployment, testing, and maintenance.
- Component Isolation: Different functionalities and logical units are isolated into their own modules, allowing independent development and scaling.
- In-Process Performance: As all modules run in the same process space, we avoid the network overhead often associated with distributed systems.

## Core Components

- Complaint Management: The central hub for all complaint-related activities.
- User Authentication: Responsible for secure user logins and permissions.
- Analytics and Reporting: Geared towards data-driven insights.
- Workflow Engine: Governs the flow of activities and logic within the system.

## Interaction Boundaries

Each component has a clearly defined interface, ensuring structured interactions and minimizing the impact of changes in one module on others.

## Code Reusability

The design encourages code reusability. Shared functionalities, like logging or authentication, are centrally located but can be accessed and utilized by all other modules.

## Future Scalability

The architecture allows for easy future enhancements. New components can be integrated seamlessly, without disrupting existing functionalities.

By adopting this architectural approach, the E-CMS ensures that while the system remains straightforward and cohesive, it also benefits from modular flexibility, making it both easy to manage and extensible.
