title: Performance Optimization
---

As the hub of electronic complaint management, the E-CMS is expected to handle a high volume of concurrent users and transactions. To ensure that performance is not compromised under any condition, a series of optimizations have been implemented across various layers of the application.

### Backend Language: Rust

After evaluating several programming languages and their performance benchmarks, Rust was chosen for its superior speed and memory safety features. Compared to traditional languages, Rust offers significant performance gains, which is crucial for processing and analyzing large sets of data in real-time.

### Data Caching

For frequent read operations, a caching layer has been implemented to reduce database load and improve data retrieval times. This is especially beneficial for operations like complaint status checks, where a fast response is crucial for user satisfaction.

### Load Balancing

To efficiently distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, a load-balancing strategy has been employed. This ensures that no single server bears too much load, thereby maintaining high availability and reliability.

### Database Optimization

Both Planetscale and Qdrant databases have been fine-tuned for optimal performance. Query optimization and indexing strategies are in place to expedite data retrieval and modification operations.

### GRPC Communication

Given its lightweight nature and high-speed capabilities, GRPC is used for internal service communications. It outperforms traditional HTTP-based methods, making data exchanges between services faster and more efficient.

### Image and File Compression

To minimize bandwidth usage and improve load times, all image and document attachments undergo a compression process before being stored or transmitted.

### Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts

A real-time monitoring system is in place to constantly check the performance metrics of the application. Any performance degradation triggers immediate alerts, allowing for quick corrective actions.

Through these strategies, the E-CMS aims to provide a robust and responsive platform capable of handling varying levels of demand without compromising on speed or user experience.
