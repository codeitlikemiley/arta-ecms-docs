## Introduction
The core application of the Electronic Complaint Management System (E-CMS) serves as the pivotal component in our architecture pattern, responsible for facilitating the end-to-end complaint management process. This application is not merely a technological entity but a sophisticated layer designed to harmonize with business rules, regulations, and user interactions.

The primary objective of this section is to outline the essential design considerations and goals that have guided the development of the application layer within our chosen architectural pattern. These range from ensuring an intuitive user interface to implementing complex business logics like "ARTABLE," as well as seamless integration with external services and systems such as Gmail Add-Ons and various APIs.

In aligning with these objectives, we focus on achieving high standards in security, performance, scalability, and availability, aiming to deliver a robust and reliable system that can evolve in response to changing needs and requirements.


## Objectives
