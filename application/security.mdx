title: Security Best Practices

## 1. Authentication and Data Transmission:

OAuth 2.0: Utilize OAuth 2.0 with token-based authentication to securely authenticate users and services. Integrating OAuth with multi-factor authentication (MFA) can provide an extra layer of security.
HTTPS: All data transmission will be encrypted using HTTPS, utilizing strong cipher suites and perfect forward secrecy to mitigate the risk of data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 2. Container Security:

Docker Multi-Stage Build: Implement Docker multi-stage builds to only include the essential elements needed to run the application. This not only minimizes the container size but also reduces the potential attack surface.
Non-Root User: Run the application as a non-root user (web) within the container. If an attacker gains container access, they won't have root privileges, severely limiting their capabilities.

## 3. Minimal Runtime Environment:

Distroless Base Image: Use Google's Distroless base images that are designed to contain only the application and its runtime dependencies. This eliminates any extra binaries that could be exploited.

## 4. Data and File Management:

Isolated Working Directory: Use a segregated working directory (/app) for the application. This directory isolation prevents unauthorized access to other parts of the file system.
Explicit COPY Commands: In your Dockerfile, use explicit COPY commands to ensure that only the files that are strictly necessary for running the application are included in the container.

## 5. System Hardening:

No Additional Utilities: Keep the final containerized application free of additional utilities or shells. This ensures that if an attacker gains access, their ability to maneuver or exploit the system is severely limited.

## 6. Network-Level Security:

VPC and Security Groups: Deploy the services within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and use AWS security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, further isolating the services and reducing vulnerability.

## 7. Monitoring and Audit:

AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail: Utilize AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and AWS CloudTrail for auditing, which can help in identifying any unusual activity or security lapses.
