title: Security Measures
---

The E-CMS places utmost importance on security, implementing a multi-faceted approach to protect both data and operations. With a focus on both preventive and reactive measures, the platform is engineered to thwart a wide range of security threats.

### Data Encryption

To secure sensitive data, encryption is employed at multiple levels. All data in transit is encrypted using TLS, while data at rest is encrypted using advanced cryptographic algorithms.

### Authentication and Authorization

User authentication is facilitated through a robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism. Role-based access control (RBAC) is then used to restrict access to functionalities, ensuring that users can only access the areas and features relevant to their role.

### API Security

All API endpoints are secured using OAuth 2.0, and rate-limiting is in place to prevent abuse. Additionally, all API calls are logged for auditing purposes.

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

To protect against web-based threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks, a Web Application Firewall is actively in use.

### Secure File Management

Given that document attachments are a part of the complaint process, secure file storage and transmission protocols are in place. This includes virus scanning and content filtering to mitigate the risks associated with file uploads.

### Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing

To ensure ongoing security, regular audits and penetration tests are conducted. These tests help in identifying potential vulnerabilities and formulating corrective actions proactively.

### Data Backup and Disaster Recovery

To prepare for unforeseen events, a comprehensive data backup and disaster recovery plan is in place. This ensures minimal downtime and data loss in the case of a catastrophic event.

By adopting these security measures, the E-CMS aims to provide a secure environment for both users and administrators, instilling confidence in the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
