To ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, the E-CMS is equipped with robust error handling and troubleshooting mechanisms. These features aim to identify issues quickly, provide meaningful feedback to users, and facilitate rapid resolution by administrators.

### Exception Handling

The system is designed with extensive exception handling to capture and manage unexpected errors. When an exception occurs, it is logged for review while providing the user with a friendly, generic error message.

### User Feedback on Errors

In the event of an error, users are presented with a message indicating that something went wrong, along with an option to report the issue. This provides a mechanism for immediate user feedback, which aids in speedy resolution.

### Log Management

Detailed error logs are maintained to assist in troubleshooting. These logs capture essential information like the type of error, the timestamp, and the affected module or operation.

### Monitoring and Alerts

Real-time monitoring tools keep track of system performance and health. If an error or anomaly is detected, automated alerts notify the system administrators immediately for prompt action.

### Rollback Mechanisms

The system is equipped with rollback mechanisms to revert any changes in case of failure, minimizing the impact on users and data integrity.

### Documentation and FAQs

Detailed documentation and FAQs are available to help users and administrators understand common issues and their resolutions, reducing the burden on customer support.

### Issue Tracking

An internal issue tracking system is in place to manage and prioritize errors and bugs reported. This allows for organized and efficient resolution.

By incorporating these features for error handling and troubleshooting, the E-CMS aims to minimize service interruptions, improve user satisfaction, and maintain a high standard of system integrity.
