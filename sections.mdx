1. **[Services](./services/index)**:

   - **Service Definitions**: List and describe the various services or microservices that make up your system. This includes both internal and external services. Mention the purpose of each service and its responsibilities.

   - **Communication Protocols**: Specify how services communicate with each other. This could include the use of gRPC for internal communication, RESTful APIs for external interfaces, message queues for asynchronous processing, and any other relevant protocols.

   - **Service Dependencies**: Document dependencies between services. Which services rely on others, and how do they interact? This helps in understanding the flow of data and requests within the system.

   - **API Documentation**: If applicable, provide detailed documentation for the APIs exposed by your services. Include information on request and response formats, authentication, and usage examples.

2. **Processes**:

   - **Workflow Diagrams**: Create workflow diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the processes and data flow within your system. These diagrams should show how user complaints are processed, from submission to resolution.

   - **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Describe how processes handle concurrency and parallelism. For example, how multiple complaints are handled simultaneously without conflicts.

   - **Error Handling**: Explain how errors and exceptions are handled within your processes. Define error codes, error messages, and the actions taken when errors occur.

   - **Business Logic**: Detail the core business logic that each process performs. This includes data validation, data transformation, and any algorithms used in the complaint management process.

3. **Application**:

   - **User Interfaces**: Describe the various user interfaces of your E-CMS, including web interfaces, mobile apps, and any other client applications. Explain the user journey and functionality offered by each interface.

   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Outline how user authentication and authorization are handled. What security measures are in place to protect user data and system resources?

   - **User Experience (UX)**: Discuss the user experience design principles and user-centric features that enhance usability and user satisfaction.

   - **Integration Points**: Identify third-party integrations, such as OpenAI API, and explain how these integrations enhance the functionality of your application.

4. **Infrastructure**:

   - **Deployment Architecture**: Describe how your application and services are deployed. This may involve using Google Cloud services, containers, Kubernetes, and any other infrastructure components.

   - **Scalability and Load Balancing**: Explain how your infrastructure scales to handle increased load. Detail load balancing strategies to distribute traffic effectively.

   - **Monitoring and Logging**: Describe the monitoring and logging tools and practices in place to ensure the health and performance of your infrastructure and applications.

   - **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Explain the backup and disaster recovery strategies for your data and services. How is data backed up, and how can the system recover from failures?

   - **Security Measures**: Detail the security measures implemented at the infrastructure level, including network security, firewalls, and data encryption.

   - **Cost Analysis**: Provide a cost analysis of your infrastructure, including estimates of cloud service expenses and any cost-saving measures in place.

By structuring your System Design and Architecture document in these four sections, you can provide a clear and comprehensive view of how your E-CMS functions, from the services it offers to the underlying infrastructure that supports it. Don't forget to include diagrams, charts, and any other visual aids to make the document more accessible and understandable for stakeholders and developers.
