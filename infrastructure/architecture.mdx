### Why Modular Monolith?

1. **Simplified Deployment**: Like a traditional monolith, a modular monolith can be deployed as a single unit, making the deployment process straightforward and easy to manage, especially given that you're using Google Cloud services for deployment.

2. **Communication Efficiency**: Modules within a modular monolith communicate via method calls, which are more efficient than the network calls needed in a microservices architecture. This can result in lower latency and faster response times.

3. **Data Consistency**: If your system has strong consistency requirements, a modular monolith enables you to maintain ACID transactions across multiple modules easily.

4. **Team Scalability**: Unlike traditional monoliths, modular monoliths can scale reasonably well with larger development teams if the modules are well-isolated, which your tech stack of Rust, gRPC, and Planetscale can enforce effectively.

5. **Simpler for Smaller Teams**: Managing a microservices architecture can require a larger ops team and more complex infrastructure, which might not align with your project’s current scope or staffing.

6. **Evolutionary Path**: If ever you decide that some components are better off as separate services, a well-designed modular monolith can be broken down into microservices at a later stage with relatively less pain.

7. **Easier Troubleshooting**: Having a single codebase can make it easier to troubleshoot and debug the system, as you don't have to trace issues through a network of microservices.

8. **Reduced Operational Complexity**: Since everything is running as a single service, you don't need to coordinate multiple services, which often requires additional tools and adds complexity to the system.



## How Does Rust Fit into This?
Performance: Rust provides near C-level performance, which is advantageous for building high-performance modules.
Concurrency: Rust's concurrency model can be beneficial in a monolithic architecture where managing multiple tasks efficiently is crucial.
Memory Safety: One of the key features of Rust is its focus on memory safety without sacrificing performance, which makes it a strong fit for complex back-end logic.
Strong Typing: Rust’s strong type system is well-suited for a modular approach, ensuring interface contracts between modules are strictly enforced at compile-time.
Package Management: Rust’s package manager, Cargo, simplifies dependency management, making it easier to build and maintain modular applications.
Community and Ecosystem: Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools, many of which are well-suited for building modular back-end systems, including frameworks and libraries for web services, data manipulation, and more.
Interoperability: Rust can easily interoperate with C and other languages, making it possible to wrap or replace individual modules written in other languages without having to replace the entire system.
